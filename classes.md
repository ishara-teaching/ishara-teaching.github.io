*Taught Fall 2013 (1 section, 83 students), co-taught with [Dr. Sarah Heckman](http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/sesmith5/)*

During Fall 2013, I co-taught a section of CSC 230 which met twice a week for 75 minutes. CSC 230 is a sophomore-level course required for all Computer Science majors as well as student pursuing a programming certificate or minor. CSC 230 is a large lecture course with over 60 students in a section, and also contains a sizable Distance Education cohort. CSC 230 teaches students their second programming language in the Computer Science program, the C language, which is a lower-level language than Java, which is taught first. This introduces them to lower-level computing concepts in order to prepare them for courses like Operating Systems. The course is heavily lecture based, with the bulk of the final grade on 3 examinations and 6 programming-intensive projects assigned for homework.

As co-teacher, I was responsible for leading the lecture for one of the two days each week, as well as holding office hours, monitoring the message board, and serving as head TA when it came to grading. The curriculum is planned in advance without much room for flexibility when the course is in full swing. Out of the six homework projects, I developed two of them, Homework 3 and Homework 4, which are included in the portfolio. The focus of the semester was to improve my comfort with lecturing as well as learning about the time commitments of trying to teach and pursue a research agenda at the same time.
