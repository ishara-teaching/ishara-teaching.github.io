CSC 326: Software Engineering Lab
---------------------------------

*Taught Fall 2012 (2 sections, 12 and 17 students), led by [Dr. Emerson Murphy-Hill](http://people.engr.ncsu.edu/ermurph3/)*     
*Taught Spring 2013 (2 sections, 25 and 25 students), led by [Dr. Tao Xie](http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/people/txie)*

*Application of product engineering methods to software: quality assurance, project management, requirements analysis, specifications, design, development, testing, production and maintenance.*

During Fall 2012 and Spring 2013, I led two sections of the lab component of CSC 326 which met every Thursday for 110 minutes each. CSC 326 is a junior-level course required for all Computer Science majors divided into a lecture and a lab section. The purpose of the lab section is to give students the opportunity to apply the concepts they learn in lecture to a large software project called [iTrust](http://agile.csc.ncsu.edu/iTrust/wiki/doku.php). All homework assignments, which were usually broken into broad week-long tasks, were assigned through the lab section.

The activities for each lab session were determined in advance and tightly coupled with the learning objectives in the course, so my responsibility was to facilitate the lab activities and help students with both technical and conceptual issues. While I did not have the freedom to choose the activities, I did have the freedom to lead the activities as I pleased, and I took advantage of these opportunities to apply what I had learned in the FIT workshops I attended - particularly trying out different classroom assessment techniques.

Fundamentals in Teaching: Research Reading Group
------------------------------------------------

*Coordinated Fall 2012 and Spring 2013 (3 meetings each)*

*The Current Issues in Teaching Reading Group is three-part series where graduate students with an interest in teaching come together to discuss scholarly articles related to research in teaching. The Reading Group is designed to build on the skills introduced in the Fundamentals in Teaching workshops, offering students and post-docs the chance to critically analyze the current research in the field.*

The *FIT Reading Group* is an initiative that I started as part of the pilot of NC State's Preparing Future Leaders Ambassadors program. Offered formally through the [Fundamentals in Teaching Program](http://www.ncsu.edu/grad/preparing-future-leaders/teaching-programs/fit/) and coordinated with Dr. Barbi Honeycutt, the Reading Group is designed to bring together Graduate Students and Postdocs with an interest in teaching to discuss the state of the art in educational research.

The Fall 2012 Reading Group focused on research in *assessment and evaluation*, and the Spring 2013 Reading Group focused on *games and social media*. Each semester, we met once per month for three months and discussed the paper in the same manner as a reading session that would be coordinated by a professor for the students in his or her lab.

 * Session 1: Pare, D. E., & Joordens, S. (2008). Peering into large lectures: Examining peer and expert mark agreement using peerScholar, an online peer-assessment tool. *Journal of Computer Assisted Learning*, 24(6), 526-540. (7 Participants)
 * Session 2: Yazon, J. M. O., Mayer-Smith, J. A., & Redfield, R. J. (2002). Does the medium change the message? The impact of a web-based genetics course on university students' perspectives on learning and teaching. *Computers & Education*, 38(1), 267-285. (8 Participants)
 * Session 3: Scott, A. K., Oliver, J. S., & Knauft, D. A. (2007). Examining the Impact of Service-Learning on College Science Students' Self-Report of their Learning Styles. *NACTA Journal*, (September), 2-9. (6 Participants)
 * Session 4: Peterson, M. (2010). Computerized Games and Simulations in Computer-Assisted Language Learning: A Meta-Analysis of Research. *Simulation & Gaming*, 41(1), 72â€“93. (8 Participants)
