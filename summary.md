Executive Summary
-----------------

Participating in the FIT workshops and CoAT program have been a tremendously valuable experience. Even though I had attended nearly all of the workshops offered before I ever formally enrolled in CoAT or started teaching, the workshops take on a completely new light when I'm able to think about them in terms of the concrete experiences I've had as a teaching assistant in a lab-intensive course. I feel as though many TAs simply fumble through their first teaching experiences overwhelmed by the responsibility of leading a class, so I'm grateful that this program gave me an opportunity not only to reflect on my teaching, but to turn this first year into an intentional experience where I was able to put the theoretical ideas that I picked up from the FIT workshops into practice and to find a flow that I could fit into where I would be comfortable.

One of the most important things I've learned through this year is that things don't always go as planned, which makes the planning even more important. Knowing what material I want to cover and how I want to cover it, even if I don't manage to get to it, is important so that I can figure out how to adapt my instruction based on the current levels of preparation and understanding of the students in the course. Just because plans never seem to work out isn't an excuse for not planning in the first place, as I learned for myself in the first semester. Deviating from plans isn't necessarily a bad thing, as flexibility is often just as important as planning.

During my teaching this year, I didn't have a lot of freedom to take the course in my own direction. A lab session, to a certain extent, is perceived as "supplemental" to the primary course content, meaning that everything I do is secondary to the course content covered in the lectures. I did share some of my suggestions with the course staff, and even got a warm response for them, but they were ultimately tabled because CSC 326 is such an important part of the curriculum and there was no guarantee that I would be with the course long enough to follow up on any changes I set in motion.

Next year may give me some opportunities to explore my teaching at a deeper level. Assuming I'm accepted into the program, I'll be teaching CSC 230 (C and Software Tools) as part of Preparing the Professoriate. This will give me a bit more flexibility to explore active learning in Computer Science since I will be covering the primary content for the course, and have the freedom to set up my own context rather than trying to adapt my teaching to the context that the instructor had already set up in advance for me in my lab instruction. I would be very interested in putting my philosophy of "play" in teaching to the test, so with this year of reflection behind me, I'm certain that next year's even more rigorous teaching experience will be a good one.
