Fundamentals in Teaching Workshops
----------------------------------

A great deal of my development as a teacher is thanks to the foundation of the NC State University Fundamentals in Teaching (FIT) program. FIT offers several workshops to its Graduate Students, postdocs, staff, and faculty (free of charge) on subjects ranging from Classroom Assessment Techniques to Teaching to Different Learning Styles. Some of these workshops were attended more than once, but only the first attendance is listed below.

 * *Introduction to Teaching*: A crash-course in teaching theory, covering major topics such as Bloom’s Taxonomy, in-class exercises, and developing a lesson plan - Dr. Barbi Honeycutt, Aug 22, 2011
 * *Learning Styles*: A discussion of the learning styles introduced by Felder and Silverman - Dr. Barbi Honeycutt, Sep 26, 2011
 * *Making the Most of a Mentoring Relationship*: A panel discussion focusing on the mentoring relationship between Graduate Students and their advisors. - Sep 30, 2011
 * *Emotional Intelligence*: A Tool for Teaching: A presentation discussing the awareness of the emotions of oneself and others - Dr. Rhonda Sutton, Nov 2, 2011 
 * *Responding to Student Writing*: Encouraging Reflection and Revision: A workshop focused on how to maximize the effectiveness of feedback on student writing assignments that hit on valid learning goals over insignificant issues (like spelling mistakes) - Molly Storment, Nov 7, 2011 
 * *Evaluation and Grading*: A workshop discussing grading, assessment, and design of effective rubrics - Dr. Barbi Honeycutt, Nov 18, 2011
 * *Current Issues in Teaching: How Digital Media and the Brain Science of Attention Transform Learning*: A reading group discussion of a chapter [Dr. Cathy Davidson](http://hastac.org/blogs/cathy-davidson)'s book of the same name - Molly Storment, Feb 24, 2012
 * *Helping Students Organize Their Knowledge*: A workshop on the topic of Mind-Mapping and using them to help students visualize their knowledge - Margaret Frey, Jun 5, 2012
 * *Effective Questioning Strategies*: A workshop focused on creating questions that target deeper levels of understanding, scaffolding questions to help students make connections with content, and avoiding "dead end" questions - Dr. Barbi Honeycutt, Jun 25, 2012
 * *Establishing Credibility and Authority in the Classroom*: This workshop highlighted the ways in which students undermine authority and disrupt classes, whether actively (verbal altercations) or passively (showing up late) - Dr. Barbi Honeycutt, Jun 23, 2012
 * *Designing an Effective Syllabus*: An introduction to good syllabus design and organization, focusing on elements that all syllabi must contain in order to be useful resources for a class - Sarah Eagan Warren, Nov 2, 2012



Certificate of Accomplishment in Teaching
-----------------------------------------
The CoAT program is an initiative at NC State University where Graduate Students can participate in an intensive series of workshops while reflecting on two semesters of teaching in a classroom or lab setting. As part of the CoAT program, I wrote two *synthesis and reflecton* essays bringing everything I’ve learned in the FIT workshops together. I was awarded the CoAT certificate in December of 2013.

 * [Teaching Through Grading]({{ site.portfolio }}coat/grading_essay.pdf), discussing a tool I developed in order to turn grading from a chore into a teaching opportunity
 * [Lesson Plans]({{ site.portfolio }}coat/lesson_plan_essay.pdf), why I make a lesson plan for every single class
 * [Letter of Recommendation]({{ site.portfolio }}coat/coat_recommendation.pdf), a letter of recommendation from the CoAT facilitators.
