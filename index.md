Welcome!
--------
This is the teaching portfolio of [Barry Peddycord III](http://isharacomix.org).
Here, I maintain a public-facing, curated record of my experience as a teacher.
The purpose of this website is to give potential students and collaborators an
opportunity to see examples of my past work as a teacher, my philosophy of
teaching. I also maintain links to the course web pages of courses I am actively
teaching.
