Welcome!
--------
This is the teaching portfolio of [Barry Peddycord III](http://isharacomix.org),
developed as part of NC State's *Preparing the Professoriate* program. The
portfolio is divided into four main sections, which can be accessed at any time
via the tabs across the top of the page.

### Teaching Philosophy ###
My personal outlook on teaching and how I exercise my values in the classroom.

### Classes Taught ###
A record of my teaching experience, featuring details about the contexts in which
I have taught and the artifacts developed during the course of teaching. Included
here are descriptions of my classes, lesson plans, course evaluations, homework
assignments and other elements that highlight elements of instruction.

### Professional Development ###
This section contains information on experiences outside of the classroom I have
pursued to develop my teaching skills. This primarily contains essays and
exercises done as part of the requirements of the *Certificate of Accomplishment
in Teaching* and the *Preparing the Professoriate* programs, demonstrating my
commitment to self-improvement beyond my usual duties in the classroom.

### Executive Summary ###
This piece of writing ties the portfolio together by covering the impact of the
Preparing the Professoriate program on my teaching career.
