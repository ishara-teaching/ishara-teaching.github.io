<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>
This is the teaching portfolio of <a href="http://isharacomix.org">Barry
Peddycord III</a>. Here, I maintain a public-facing, curated record of my
experience as a teacher. The purpose of this website is to give potential
students and collaborators an opportunity to see examples of my past work
as a teacher, my philosophy of teaching. I also maintain links to the course
web pages of courses I am actively teaching.
