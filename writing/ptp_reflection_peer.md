PTP Reflection for Peer Observation
-----------------------------------
Getting to participate in the peer observation process was an excellent part of the PTP program. I worked with Terri Billeisen, a graduate student in Entomology, and we both attended one of each others' lectures, kept a [log]({{ site.portfolio }}classes/fall2013_csc230/observation_log.pdf), wrote a [report]({{ site.portfolio }}ptp/ptp_peer_observation.pdf) and had a [discussion]({{ site.portfolio }}ptp/ptp_observation_discussion.pdf) about the lecture and where we wanted to improve going forward. As both a recipient and provider of this feedback, I've learned about critically analyzing my own and others' teaching - a responsibility that I'll have when I start a career in the academy.



After spending so much time teaching classes ranging from 50 to 80 students in size, it's interesting to see the dynamic in a smaller class in a different field, especially among non-majors. Even in the small courses in Computer Science, so many of the students are coming from the same background of courses and skill sets that the classes feel rather homogenous. Terri's teaching was very heavily influenced by visuals that you can't really bring up in computer science, so it was interesting having to evaluate this very different teaching context.
